//! The music-library data model — `Artist`, `Album`, `Song` — shared by the
//! Apple Music service and the UI.
//!
//! The types live outside `apple_music` because both the integration seam
//! (which populates them) and the presentation layer (which renders them)
//! depend on them; the service module alone is not their owner. Keeping them
//! here, beside the shared `state` module, means the real Apple Music API can
//! replace the stub without touching the model or the UI.
